                        I am a former mechanical engineer from the United States.  I graduated with a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and worked as mostly a design engineer while playing other engineering roles to suit my company as well.

                        Currently, I live in Toronto, Canada in the North York region.  After coming here, I went to a coding bootcamp to hone my skills and fine tune them in order to blossom a passion of mine.

                        One thing I can confidently say is that I'm always learning something new, whether it's business practices, engineering disciplines, or coding languages.  It's nice to keep yourself fresh, I believe.  Staying on your toes is a must in a technical field, regardless of what specific type is being considered.

                        My engineering skills extend to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Design Engineering.  Here is where I spent most of my time and my titles and roles generally pertained to this facet.  Some of the skills I picked up here include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Solidworks
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        AutoDesk Inventor
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Catia
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Quality Engineering.  I spent some time helping a company maintain their standards and devising solutions to combat irregularities or statistically significant variations to part dimensions that were functionally broken or insufficient.  Here, I had to pick up a variety of skills on the fly, such as:  
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        RCA - Root Cause Analysis
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Inspection
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Gages
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Tooling
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>
            </main>
